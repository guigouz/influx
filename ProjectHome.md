# in·flux (ĭn'flŭks') #

  1. A flowing in: an influx of foreign capital.
  1. A mass arrival or incoming: an influx of visitors to the city; large influxes of data in a http request.

> Influx is currently on preview phase. Although I believe the [API](API.md) has pretty much stabilized, it was only used on two projects, and there are many details that need special attention.

> If you want to help, testing and bugging me is a nice way, I tried to make it easy to understand with nice examples and documentation that's easy to read.

> Hope this lib helps you.
